## How It Works

PageParrot is powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W single-board computer and a USB webcam. It runs a [Python script](https://github.com/nickbild/audiobook/blob/main/read_page.py) that waits for a button press, then snaps a picture of the book with the webcam. The image is then sent to Googleâ€™s Gemini 2.5 Flash large language model, along with a prompt instructing it to tell me all the text contained in the image. The text it returns is then fed into Piper to synthesize speech, which is played on a Bluetooth speaker.
